	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<h2>Project Team #9</h2>
	<h3>Jacob Ackerman</h3>
	<p>A computer science major taking Japanese classes on the side for fun. Misses playing marimba but those are expensive, so someone needs to buy out this website. It's
	going to be the next Amazon, but for bread. Million dollar idea, please just buy it. I just want to play the marimba.</p>

	<h2>About The Project</h2>
	<p>This website is to function as a sort of bread cataloging website that doubles as a place you could order bread from. The discussion page is for people to leave their thoughts and feelings about the various bread types and the index page acts as a place to see what's new on the website. The comment function currently only locally adds comments that disappear on reload, but it's my understanding that things we learn later will allow us to permanently add them for the final project.</p>
